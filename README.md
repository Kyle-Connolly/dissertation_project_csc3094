If encountering console errors:
Please note that StarterAssetsInputsActions.cs is generated automatically with the Library folder which conflicts with StarterAssetsInputs.cs - the correct file. 
To resolve the resulting namespace error when the Library folder has been regenerated, simply delete the StarterAssetsInputsActions.cs file in the folder: Assets/StarterAssets/InputSystem.
DO NOT delete StarterAssetsInputs.cs.

Please open the scene "Level 1" to begin if not already open. To play the game press the play button in the editor. This should spawn you into Level 1.
